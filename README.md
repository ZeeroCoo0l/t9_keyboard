# ðŸ“± T9 Text Prediction App

This is a JavaFX-based text input app that mimics the classic **T9 predictive text system** â€” the kind youâ€™d find on old-school mobile phones. It's built using Java 21, JavaFX, and FXML, with a custom word suggestion engine under the hood.

## ðŸ§  How it works

- Words are loaded into a `TreeMap` keyed by their T9 sequence (e.g., `"4663"` â†’ `"GOOD"`)
- A `PriorityQueue` ranks word suggestions based on usage frequency and term frequency
- The UI is built using JavaFX + FXML and updates suggestions in real-time as you "type"
